Big Data Astronomical Catalogs  

The goal of this repository is to show rlevant astronomical catalogues with curated data. As a passionate astronomy amateur, I've always looked at famous databases and interesting and meaningful information within. Files must be:
- in .csv format in order to be easily uploadable in big data tools, and of course in excel
- in a curated format where db errors are the least possible
